# Unfinished features

These files were created a while ago for some feature but were never finished or haven't been used in a long time. 
If we ever want to add them back, we can copy them from here.


### Semesterly.js

At one point, we were going to add support for northeastern to semesterly with the data from search neu. The code worked a while ago, but we didn't end up keeping up with it. Code has been removed from search neu.

https://github.com/noahpresler/semesterly/pull/1041
https://github.com/ryanhugh/searchneu/blob/a8fc0b442807346523889ac3fe9a3638169a715f/backend/scrapers/classes/processors/semesterly.js

In order to install the code in Semesterly, Search NEU was published to npm here (https://www.npmjs.com/package/searchneu). The deployment code was in .travis.yml and there was some semver code at the bottom of travis_deploy.sh. This code has all be removed. 



They are in the codebase at commit [0958ad3a2ddf72425f3e18b268e9d2dd6c945f88](https://github.com/ryanhugh/searchneu/commit/0958ad3a2ddf72425f3e18b268e9d2dd6c945f88).

### login.js

This code started with just a MyNEU username and password.  
And logged into the old MyNEU (yeah, the one that was taken down in 2018 and is no longer around)  
and then navigated to TRACE using only raw requests and not a headless browser.  
which made it pretty fast - and avoided unneeded dependencies on headless browsers.

### clubs.js

If we ever want to add support for clubs at Northeastern, we can work on this file some more.
It pulls data about clubs from a few spots on Northeastern's website (orgsync).

### Spread

Added the concept of points, and gave people points if they referred people and points gave people priority when getting notifications for classes. Idea abandonded a while ago, and not much work was ever done on this.
